Exciting news! We're hosting a LinkedIn live event with a Digital Commerce Expert and a Tech Leader [Pasi Vuorio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pasivuorio) and AI & ML Guru [Tero Keski-Valkama](https://www.costacoders.es/coders/tero-keski-valkama) next Wednesday at 1 pm CEST.

Large language models held much more power than just generating marketing texts and chatting with your clients. Pasi Vuorio and Tero Keski-Valkama have been exploring the topic much deeper that that. We're going to present our latest discoveries and discuss about topics like:

- Where are we currently in the part towards AGI. When can we expect big breakthroughs?
- What LLM's are good in and what are their weaknesses
- How we can extend the basic capabilities of LLMs
- What the state of open source LLMs
- What should you expect to see in next few months & years.

Warning: We will dive quite deep to the topics; don't expect novel advice on how to prompt the best email-template...

Looking forward to see you there!
