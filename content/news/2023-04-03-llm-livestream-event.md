Exciting news! We're hosting a LinkedIn live event with a Digital Commerce

Large language models hold much more power than just generating marketing texts and chatting with your clients.

Pasi Vuorio and Tero Keski-Valkama have been exploring the topic much deeper that that. We're going to present our latest discoveries and discuss about topics like:

- Where are we currently in the quest towards AGI. When can we expect big breakthroughs?
- What LLMs are good at and what are their weaknesses
- How we can extend the basic capabilities of LLMs
- What is the state of open source LLMs
- What should you expect to see in next few months & years.

Warning: We will dive quite deep to the topics; don't expect novel advice on how to prompt the best email-template...

Looking forward to see you there!
