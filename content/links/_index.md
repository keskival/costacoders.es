It is important to take back control of the web from the monopolistic search engines. There are two main search engines in the western world currently, Google and Bing, and every other search engine is using the indexes from these two. To get one's site indexed and ranked, it requires registering to Google and Microsoft and with their economic interests it makes sense for them to rank paying customers the highest, then sites which use their tracking cookies, and finally, the ever decreasing part of the web, the grassroots with no economic or personal data source associations to these large corporations. That's where we are. So, here are links.
