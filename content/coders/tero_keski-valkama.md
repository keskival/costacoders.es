Hellos!
I am the founder of this community, a generalist and a technologist.
I have programmed computers since I was six years old, starting with a Commodore 64.
I moved to Benalm√°dena in April 2022.
I am doing a lot of cutting-edge AI research.
Feel free to add me as a connection or a friend on any of the linked platforms!
