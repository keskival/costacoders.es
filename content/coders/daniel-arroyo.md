Hi there! after living in Finland and California for 15 years, I have now settled in Benalm√°dena since 2015 where I cofunded and run the tech side of [Nieve Consulting Services](https://www.nieveconsulting.com). A modern software agency where we aim to bring better working conditions and ways of working to create quality software from the Costa del Sol.

I worked for a long time at Nokia where I created and patented software that at some point run in 100s of millions of smartphones. Since 2011 though my passion swifted to tech startups. I went through a few accelerators with my companies: Founder Institute, 500 Startups and Techstars. 

I raised money from angel investors and VCs, had fun, suffered, created success, failures and sold a business. All while coding along the way, learning from customers, re-factoring, launching MVPs, re-doing UIs...

Outside of coding and crafting software products, my other passion is flying. While living in California I got my private pilot's license and bought a Mooney M20C from the 60s which I flew all over California, Nevada and Arizona. Unfortunately since living in Spain, I haven't yet retaken this hobby.
